- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Evolutionary COmputation and Learning Systems (ECOLS) Research Group

Currently, it is being operated from the University of the South Pacific, Fiji. Our research interest mainly includes
 - Guiding Neural Networks through gradient descent or curriculum learning
 - Oversampling with SMOTified-GAN - a new data augmentation method
 - Parallalization of SGD for big data
 - Bilevel optimization with evoluionary algorithms
 - Static & dynamic constraint optimization with meta-heuristic algorithms
 - Video Abstraction
